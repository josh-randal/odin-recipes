        <h4>Vegan Lasagna</h4>
        <p> This protein packed vegan lasagna will knock your socks off. 
            Make it with or without ground 'beef' the tart tomato sauce
            made with lentils make for a hearty dish. If your a 'cheese' 
            lover, you'll love the spinach ricotta and may have some 
            leftover to use on other dishes. I love it on bagles! A small
            kick of the creamy cashew sauce on top will be the final touch
            beatuiful presentation for your guests to enjoy. Lasagna is an 
            dish for everyone, both to make and eat. Vegans and Non-vegans 
            can't resist a good pasta dish regardless of its protein type.</p>
